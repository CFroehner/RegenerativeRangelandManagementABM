# RegenerativeRangelandManagementABM

This repository contains the code for the agent-based model and experiments used in the study ["Eliminating climate change mitigation trade-offs in African rangelands,"](link to paper) which explores how pairing forecasts with conservation programming can reduce trade-offs among vegetation cover, livestock numbers, and wealth inequality, supporting effective adaptation to climate change at scale.

## Repository structure
- **RunModel.R**: Code for the agent-based model (ABM). Sources landscape files from `StylizedLandscape` and precipitation from `PrecipTimeseries.R` to create the initial landscape and generate precipitation scenarios. Runtime for one full setting across the three climate scenarios is ~45 minutes. It also supports a toy quickstart via environment variables.
- **ToyRun.R**: Code for a toy run of ``RunModel.R``.
- **GeneratePlots.R**: Code to reproduce visualizations for experiments 1-3 and supplementals from the manuscript. It expects ABM outputs in a Ts_Data-style folder (see below).
- **ExperimentConditions.rds**, **ConditionsExp1.rds**: Predefined experimental settings for running the ABM, used in manuscript experiments 1 to 3 and supplemental material (forecast settings, provision of supplemental fodder, social learning settings, etc.). The file ``ConditionsExp1.rds`` includes the conditions for experiment 1 only to run the toy example.
- **StylizedLandscape/**: Scripts and inputs for creating the stylized landscape.
- **AncillaryScripts/**: Ancillary scripts and inputs used for deriving parameters and settings for the ABM. To run `PredictedRainfall.R`, download [precipitation projection data] (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/projections-cmip6?tab=download).

## Prerequisites
- R ≥ 4.1
- Packages for ABM and visualizations:
```
packages ‹- c(
"data. table", "doParallel", "doRNG", "sp", "foreach", "dplyr", "sf", "raster", "in
"gstat", "spdep", "ggplot2", "tidyverse", "cowplot", "ggh4x", "ggthemes",
"vroom", "glue", "fs", "purri", "tibble"
)
install.packages (setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages ())))
```
- Download the `povmap-grdi-v1.tif` file [here](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiPw7h8k9QaACopENWok9m/) and add on the level of the ```StylizedLandscape/`` folder.

## Toy example (quickstart)
The repo includes a small toy run that reproduces the core pipeline without the full ABM runtime. If you keep the plot pane open, you’ll see the stylized landscape update as the run progresses.

**What it does**
- Runs a minimal ABM configuration (one repetition of 100 timesteps across 3 precipitation scenarios, using only the conditions from experiment 1) and writes the outputs to Ts_Data_toy/.
- Generates ABM burn-in plot into Manuscript_Vis_toy/.

```
  Rscript RunToy.R
```

## Reproduce the full experiments

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/matthewclark1223/RegenerativeRangelandManagementABM.git
  cd RegenerativeRangelandManagementABM
 ```

2. Generate data

*Option A (full run, long):*
```bash
  Rscript RunModel.R
  ```

*Option B (use pregenerated data):*

Download [`Ts_Data`]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G6POSfm8SaYC4ZBgtwkPUq5TDhat1wRN/view?usp=sharing](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiPw7h8k9QaACopENWok9m/)) and place the folder in the repo root next to the scripts.

3. Analyze and plot:
```bash
  # default expects Ts_Data and writes to Manuscript_Vis
  Rscript GeneratePlots.R
  ```

## How to customize the agent-based model

1. Modify the model in `RunModel.R`. Sections in the script correspond to manuscript modules (e.g., T0 set-up/initialization of landscape, grazing, etc.).
2. Play with settings (e.g., animal cost, capital gain rate, etc.) in the `RunModel.R` section `Model parameters`.
3. Adjust plots in GeneratePlots.R (facets, normalization, themes).
